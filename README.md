# 2048-puzzle
This is (or was) my first ever mini project in Python. 
I started its development after I finished my 12th grade, and have made changes to it, adding new features, whenever I felt like, ever since. 

I have stopped developing it now, and it works pretty good.

The code may seem a little difficult to understand and less "modular", but it was, in fact my first ever project!

The code has been converted into a standalone executable using cx_freeze module. The executable and its dependencies can be found in the "build.zip".

The executable and its dependencies have been compiled into a single Windows Installer File (setup.exe). You can just download and execute it and the game will be installed automatically.

I installed via the 'setup.exe', please run the game as administrator everytime.
